# face_servo_tracking
Face detection, tracking and recognition + servo-control of arduino robotic head


Warning: the main branch runs : the kalman filtering is however not applied to all trajectories. (corrected in Development branch)
There is still a lot of work to do on the criterion under which unrecognized faces are not sent to the GUI for identification.
